# linter-raml
Atom Linter for Restful Api Modeling Language based on RAML Cop

# This is not working yet
I'm quite new to Coffee Script and Atom Linter and I tried to inspire me from existing project but I cannot make it work.
To try to help me out:
 
`npm install -g raml-cop`

`apm install linter`
 
Then clone the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/lolobosse/linter-raml.git`

Then link it to your atom:

`apm link <folder where you cloned it>`
